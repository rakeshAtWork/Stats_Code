// Space complexity is further divided in to two part:

// Input space : To take user input

// Auxalary space : space required to run the logic  (sometimes reffred as extra space to solve the problem)


// space complexity is mostly measure in Big-O O(n)



// keep in mind that never do anything width the data which is given for the calculation


// 1 sec = 10^8 operation for server opertion.
